How to compile: git clone https://github.com/usc-csci350-spring2023/project-3-canyonzh_rrchawla.git

On a Docker image: make qemu-nox

How to run: test1, test2, test3 to run test1.c, test2.c, and test3.c, see the graphs as apart of these repo, note graph 3 pdf would not load so we committed a screenshot of the graph with the time slices. It should also work if you download the pdf from github and open it locally but for some reason it wasn't showing up.

Should be the same for VM

Notes:

DESCRIPTION:
